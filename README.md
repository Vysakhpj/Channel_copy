# channel copy
This is a project which copies raw data from one file to another file using a channel buffer which is similar to that of a copy function. The user has the freedom to chose the length of the buffer, length of the string that has to be written into the channel buffer from the source file and the length of the string to read from the channel buffer and write to the destination file.
